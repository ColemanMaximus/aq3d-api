# AQ3D API Wrapper for Python

---
This is a package for Python which aims to
have complete practical coverage of the AQ3D API.

### API Coverage

- **Servers**
  - GET server statistics such as player counts.
  - Capture timestamped server snapshots for logging or charting graphs.
- **Items**
  - POST fetch items using item IDs.
  - Use a min and max range to fetch a range of items.


Save data CSV and JSON files with a single method either
`to_csv(Path)` or `to_json_file(Path)` on the container objects.

---

### TODOs

- Refactor all HTTP requests to use async for non blocking operations.
- API for more types
  - **Maps**
  - **NPCs**
  - **Dialogues**
  - **Class Skills**
  - **Machine Data**

### How To Use

- **Coming Soon**

_This project was intended for learning purposes, and for
a way to easily interface with AQ3D's API endpoints. Please use fairly, 
and within the terms and conditions by Artix Entertainment themselves._
